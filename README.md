# AmpMod
This is a repository for an audio plugin that performs amplitude modulation with triangle and square waves. The modulation frequency ranges from 1 Hz to 25 Hz. This repository is dependent on [IPlug2](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2) framework and its dependencies.

[Triangle Wave](/resources/plugin_image_tri.png)

The image above shows the plugin performing amplitude modulation with triangle wave. The right most knob shows that it is 0% square wave and 100% triangle wave.

[Square Wave](/resources/plugin_image_sq.png)

The image above shows the plugin performing amplitude modulation with square wave. The right most knob shows that it is 100% square wave and 0% triangle wave.


## Updates
Updated README, triangle wave calculation, and precision on 11/12/2020.
